104962,05-11-2022,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"We refinanced our home with XXXX, who sold our mortgage to SunWest Mortgage. We set up our mortgage on automatic payment, so there have been no late fees. 
An escrow account was set up as part of the refinance. We were supposed to have two months "" buffer, '' and during the refinance, {$480.00} was placed in the escrow account, with {$300.00} escrow payment due each month to cover Homeowner 's Insurance, FHA Insurance, and County Taxes. We just completed our first year, and our property taxes went up by {$100.00} for the year. As of today, we had over {$700.00} in our account, which is more than the 2-month buffer. 
SWMC raised our mortgage from {$1300.00} to {$1400.00} and they claimed they want our "" starting balance for the new year '' to be {$1100.00}, which is about 4-5 times the original 2-month buffer. 
SWMC claims it is for the upcoming year 's anticipated "" shortage '' based on their "" analysis. '' Our escrow only covers 3 items to analyze as previously stated : Property taxes, FHA Insurance, and Homeowner 's Insurance. The FHA Insurance is not going up. The Homeowner 's Insurance has no claims ( and has never had a claim in 10 years ), so its rates are n't going up. That leaves an anticipated increase in property taxes. 
From the time we refinanced until this year, there was a {$50.00} shortage in our taxes, which they just took out this month. 
Currently, we were told we have a $ XXXX balance, and our taxes are due in XXXX. SWMC wants to pay the taxes early ( in XXXX ), claiming that when they do so, we will be in the negative because they will also pay FHA at the end of the month. 
They raised our Escrow to {$310.00} ( from {$300.00} ) to cover the difference in taxes. Then they added another $ XXXX/mo on top of the adjusted escrow payment each month. The new escrow payment is high enough that it will cover ALL payments ( taxes, property insurance, and FHA insurance ), and by this time next year, the buffer will still be there. 
Basically, SWMC wants to add another {$500.00} slush fund at our expense, yet they have absolutely no mathematical or legal justification to take this extra {$500.00}. 
The Math : FHA Insurance {$150.00} X 12 months = {$1800.00}. 
Property/Hazard Insurance ( 12 months ) {$650.00}. 
Property Taxes ( 12 Months ) {$1300.00} TOTAL YEARLY REQUIRED ESCROW $ XXXX Monthly escrow amount needed to cover {$3800.00} charges : $ XXXX/month Current Principal and Interest payment : {$1000.00} + {$320.00} ( adjusted for tax increase ) TOTAL NEW PAYMENT : {$130000.00} SWMC NEW Payment : {$1400.00} If the $ XXXX/month payment shown above covers ALL escrow expenditures IN FULL, and borrowers still have the 2 month required buffer, how can they legally raise our payment an ADDITIONAL $ XXXX/mo. ( $ XXXX/yr ) above the newly adjusted, higher escrow amount?

357748,07/26/2021,Mortgage,VA mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"My initial concerns included real online reviews by actual customers. The online reviews by customers raised initial concern for me when I informed my mortgage was temporarily transferred to Sun West Mortgage Company. The reviews posted by actual customers do not mean the company is a bad company but they do suggest there is room for improvement. 
I noticed attempted use of advanced psychology to give the appearance of versus real, relevant customer service by including links to fake/ company created XXXX infomercials most likely by paid actors whose point of view and opinion will be slighted in biased favor of Sun West Mortgage Company . 
It is my opinion that someone dropped the ball by not processing an electronic payment I did for XX/XX/XXXX. I did an electronic payment I received an email confirmation and I also printed out/ did a print screen and pasted the info into MS paint to ensure I had a copy of the info. Sun West is claiming that there was incorrect routing or account number which I find hard to believe as I copied and pasted the account and routing from my online checking account to my online Sun West account when placing online payment to them and receiving payment confirmation. 
I was very hesitant to be transferred to a call center XXXX and discussing my financial information, unfortunately this normal for some companies versus keeping jobs in USA. The call center was not much help, they did not discuss what the issue was or why I was being contacted, only that I was being recorded for some unknown reason ( for XXXX, a radio show, who knows ). All the call center really did was transfer me to company rep voicemail. 
I was provided the toll free number of Sun West Rep with an extension number to speak to however I could never reach them. When calling the number the automated system indicated you needed to dial an extension or press XXXX for the operator. When you pres XXXX for operator the voice system takes you back to original recording, realistically you only have the option to dial extension which goes to VM every time. 
I attempted to make a online payment on via their website XX/XX/XXXX which Sun West Mortgage intentionally blocked and prevented on their website. It is my opinion that Sun West wanted to increase revenue from late fees by blocking my ability to pay online thus increasing likeyhood that I may need to pay past XX/XX/XXXX if needing to go to XXXX XXXX. I made a very reasonable attempt to pay on time, actually multiple times that Sun West Mortgage intentionally obstructed and prevented. I also noticed that Sun West Mortgage prevented me from printing the section of the webpage that showed the detailed information preventing me for paying online, I still did a print-screen and pasted in M.S. paint and saved the webpage as alternate ways to show the truth of what they did. 
SunWest called my parents asking them for payment in regards to my house payment something that should not have been done, is rude, and I did not appreciate. Due to the inability of Sun West Mortgage to send me detailed email or letter to home fax as requested point blank I requested they speak with my legal counsel which they refused to do. Due to enclosed factors in my complaint I am writing for federal investigation and resolution. 
I am no fool, it 's a home and the bank has many legal options as do I to resolve concern such as writing ( agency name ). As soon as I can go online in their system and pay them I will do so, whether or not Sun West Mortgage ( aka SunWest ) does what they are suppose to and should do to accept and process payments from customers has yet to be seen. 
Lastly the good book says ask and ye shall receive ( XXXX ) if anyone know of places to write or apply for XXXX scholarships/ grants please email at XXXXXXXXXXXX

496433,06/30/2021,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Application, originator, mortgage broker",,"I am a XXXX in Arizona ( XXXX ) I was doing a deal with a buyer of mine that just canceled after XXXX days. We reached full acceptance of this contract on XXXX XXXX, 2021. This deal was a XXXX on an acre, just outside of XXXX AZ. The property is on septic and has a well agreement, and a road agreement. The buyer is very well qualified and just wanted a low payment with enough land to build a big workshop, so this property fit perfectly. We were done with all our inspections and sent everything to underwriting the beginning of XXXX. The good and hardworking folks at XXXX did the best they could and worked so hard on this file it amazed me. The Underwriter, Sunwest ( who was the investor that would buy the loan ) asked for corrections and for the whole packet to be re-submitted at least XXXX times and spent 3 months reviewing the file. We have XXXX of emails in which Sunwest keeps asking for things ( many times things we had already submitted numerous times ) over and over again, each time saying that they just needed this XXXX last thing and they could approve the loan. Finally after a month and a half they start looking at the well agreement, which on the surface looked fine. They requested more documentation and more and water tests and all other kinds of paperwork over and over again. The listing agent, escrow company and myself spent hours searching for all the paperwork, that was mostly online and public knowledge. All this time, XXXX & XXXX at XXXX were continually calling asking that they please just give us a Yes or a No on the file. The Seller had moved out and had to stay in a motel for a month. The Buyer had paid for a repair to properly affix the XXXX in XXXX as we were told by Sunwest then that it would close in a couple days after that was taken care of. The seller paid for a septic cert, as we were told by Sunwest underwriting that should be done before the appraisal to speed things along. The buyer also obviously paid for a home inspection, engineering report and appraisal, in addition to the repair. Plus, the buyer has to pay more rent as his lease expired, so he had to go month to month in XXXX which costs extra. Then after they finally came to the conclusion after XXXX months in underwriting that the property did not meet HUD guidelines due to the fact that we could not find corporation papers for the well group they verbally said they could not do the deal. It then took them a week to send XXXX the denial letter in writing. It is my assertion that if Sunwest had done their job correctly and had competent underwriters working for them they could have come to the same conclusion in XXXX! We have all wasted so much time and money on this file, it is ridiculous. Towards the end of XXXX it seemed to me like they were just prolonging the deal, by not answering their phones or answering XXXX and XXXX of emails asking for updates. By prolonging the pain they were just begging the buyer and seller to cancel the deal so they would not have to, because they must have realized that they had already wasted so much of everyone 's time and money that if they now denied the loan XXXX of the parties might find a way to sue them, however if the buyer or seller canceled before a denial, a lawsuit would be harder to prove. I am most likely going to have some of the best Real estate lawyers in Arizona look at the case and file for damages and whatever else they can think of, as this was absolutely ridiculous and absolutely unnecessary to wast so much of everyones time. As, I tried to tell Sunwest a XXXX times, this is not just a file, this is people 's lives that you have absolutely damaged.

I started the process around the beginning of XXXX. Everything started off smoothly, recently however, the process has been severely delayed by Sun West and it 's service providers. I have a number of questions, all of which I have addressed to Sun West, and none of which have received any sort of satisfying response ( if any at all ). I have a number of concerns regarding the process ; 1 ) My original loan processor mysteriously changed after my appraisal and I was given absolutely no understanding of why - or prior notice that it would happen. 
2 ) My appraisal took forever to order and complete - and after it was finally done in XXXX, I was advised it had passed with an evaluation of XXXX 3 ) I was contacted the next week and advised my appraisal did NOT pass and that I needed to put 40 hours worth of paint work into my garage. I had to complete that work in two days! Despite asking multiple times - no explanation was provided for why I was told it passed and why I had to wait days longer to find out it did n't. 
4 ) I was told by my original and newly assigned processor not to pay my XXXX or XXXX mortgage as these would be rolled into my new loan, however, the same company has ( as of today ) contacted me 3 times to threaten my credit if I do not immediately post a payment. Each time I call my processor they assure me everything is fine, my credit wont be affected and they will get the collection dept to stop calling - but they are still threatening me and I fell an extreme amount of pressure to sign my loan docs asap so as to avoid the credit hits for payments that Sun West advised me to skip and then further delayed due to their own mistakes. This seems to be a deliberately deceptive practice meant to financially obligate me into signing - even if I am uncomfortable. B/c otherwise my credit is irreparably damaged and I wo n't be able to get a loan anywhere. 
5 ) Once the garage was fixed and the correction was approved ( 5 days later ) I was set to close for Saturday, XXXX. I was informed it was critical to sign by that day b/c it would only leave me with 1 day at the end of the month to fund my loan and avoid credit implications!! However, upon arrival the loan docs had multiple errors and incorrectly listed my brothers name as owning my home and being married to my wife. Despite being positively terrified that my credit was going to be affected - could not sign something that said my brother and wife were married and owned my house - that is absurd!!! 
6 ) The error was correct the following Monday of this week XXXX and all closing docs were to be signed @ XXXX. I took off work early so I could be there to sign and end this mess, however Sun West again made a mistake which caused me to miss work for no reason! Finally at 7pm someone arrived to oversee the signing and it was completed. 
7 ) I am now sitting in Limbo with no guarantee that my loan will fund in time to prevent any adverse credit action that was due to a series of delays and errors that were in no way related to things within my control. 

I want someone from Sun West to call me and explain all of this! I want a guarantee that my credit will not be affected in the slightest due to this mess and I want it in writing that they will assume all responsibility required to fix my credit - should their incompetence adversely affect it!

SWMC is illegally withholding the unused balance of repair set-aside funds ( well in excess of {$2000.00} ), which it should have reimbursed to me and/or credited to my line of credit four months ago, by using a stratagem claiming that SWMC has not received proper documentation of the repairs. All repair work in connection with this loan has been fully paid for by me, and inspected and certified by an FHA inspector as required by HUD. Further, I have ( a ) documented to SWMC that I furnished all materials and paid my construction provider ( who is a licensed contractor as required and approved by SWMC ) in full, out of my own pocket, for installation, as previously agreed with SWMC ; and ( b ) provided SWMC with a "" Paid In Full '' invoice signed by my construction provider and me, as previously agreed with SWMC. In XXXX 2022 I provided SWMC with a written request for reimbursement in the amount of {$1400.00} for my final out of pocket expense for labor, at which point SWMC unlawfully refused to reimburse me as agreed. Instead SWMC demanded that I and/or my construction provider ( SWMC ca n't decide whether it 's one or both ) execute an inappropriate proprietary deposition document by falsely terming it a mechanic 's lien ( it is NOT a valid California mechanic 's lien ). Moreover, SWMC apparently dunned my construction provider with phone calls trying to find out if I really paid him. 
SWMC fraudulently skimmed inspection fees from my repair set-aside. 
SWMC fraudulently skimmed an unauthorized {$100.00} from my repair set-aside funds claiming they used it to pay for an inspection fee that I had already paid ( in fact, over-paid ) in escrow. Skimming inspection fees is a familiar tactic of predatory lenders ( XXXX ). 
SWMC is trying to force this loan into foreclosure. 
As I stated in my XXXX 2022 complaint, I believe SWMC is a lying, thieving, predatory lender using every trick in the book to have an excuse to declare this loan in default and foreclose ( my property is currently worth substantially more than the loan balance ). Likewise, it has recently become apparent that HUD is enabling SWMC 's stratagem to declare this loan in default and foreclose. On XXXX XXXX, 2022 I filed a HUD complaint against SWMC for defaulting on its repair set-aside payments to me ( XXXX reference number XXXX ). For three months various representatives at HUD, FHA, and XXXX XXXX XXXX stonewalled and spun out a string of XXXX XXXX excuses for not acting on my complaint in a timely manner, until they apparently finally ran out of excuses and announced that if SWMC wants me ( or my construction provider ) to sign a document, whether applicable or not, I ( or my construction provider ) am required to sign it. On XXXX XXXX, 2022, by letter I appealed to HUD Secretary XXXX XXXX ( copy attached ) but never received any reply or acknowledgment whatsoever. In light of HUD 's well-known unsavory mortgage sale giveaways to XXXX XXXX speculators, it is my view that HUD has proved beyond a doubt that it is more interested in lining up with its exploitative business partners, lenders and mortgagees like SWMC than with its exploited HECM borrowers. Based on my first-hand experience with the representatives at SWMC, HUD, FHA and XXXX XXXX XXXX, it 's my view that this is based on an insidious, discriminatory, stereotypical perception regarding HECM borrowers being easy prey.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Sun West Mortgage Company, Inc.",CA,902XX,,Consent provided,Web,09/27/2022,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2133481

Dear Sir or Madam : I am writing to you for the 2nd Time to dispute the validity of accounting and servicing of my mortgage, your accounting practices are such that all payments are credited to fees and/or penalties which are given application priority over principal and interest crediting which subsequently leads to your compounding additional late fees when the security note expressly states that late fees is applied to currently due principal and interest only. Moreover, there is no continuity of contact, your email communications contain the perfunctory tag "" single point of contact '' for the sake of appearing to comply with the law, ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ) contact with XXXX different individuals does not equate single point of contact. However, upon calling that person is not available, whomever answers the call greets you with he/she is not available but I can or I 'll transfer to someone else in that department who can help, questions regarding accounting are not answered the information is not available. For example, my escrow account was being over charged, property taxes were calculated incorrectly, I was promised a return call that never occurred. 

This second request is to inform you of my need for additional information regarding various charges, credits, debits, transactions, reversals, actions, payments, analyses, and records related to the servicing of my loan from its origination to date. To date, the documents and information you have sent me, and the conversations with your service representatives, have not answered my questions. My 1st written request was on XXXX XXXX, 2022, your company acknowledged receipt of this request via email on XXXX/XXXX/2022. However as of today you have failed to provide me with any form of resolution of the errors, provide information requested validating these errors as being correct, provide investigation of my concerns and you have failed to explain in writing why you have refused to address my request. It has been over 90 days and you have essentially ignored my written request and have continued to erroneously service this mortgage, which violates RESPA. 

I am FOR THE 2nd TIME, disputing the validity of the current debt you claim I owe, including, without limitation, the principal balance, calculated monthly payment, calculated escrow payment, and any fees claimed to be owed. To validate my debt, I need to conduct a complete accounting of my mortgage loan. I also request that you conduct your own audit of my account to validate the debt you currently claim I owe. 
Please do not continue in your refusal to conduct a full audit of my account. I believe that errors have wrongfully resulted in one or all of the following : 1. Increased the amounts of my monthly payments ; 2. Increased the principal balance I owe ; 3. Increased my escrow payments ; 4. Increased the amounts applied and attributed toward interest on my account ; 5. Decreased the proper amounts applied and attributed toward principal on my account ; and/or 6. Assessed, charged, and/or collected fees, expenses, and other charges I am not legally obligated to pay under my mortgage As you failed to address my 1st written request, which you did acknowledge having received on XXXX/XXXX/2022, to insure this I will authorized an audit of my mortgage by consumer advocates with expertise in mortgage auditing and predatory lending.
